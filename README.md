# PoC-Dynamique-Table

The goal of this PoC is to provide a tabular view with the following features:
- **Source Agnostic**: Works with any collection.
- **Filterable**: Allows filtering of data.
- **View Management**: Enables saving filters and showing/hiding columns.

This PoC retrieves data from GitHub during the `App onStart` event. 

As this is a PoC, you may occasionally encounter filtering issues. If you notice any problems, please refresh the editor.
